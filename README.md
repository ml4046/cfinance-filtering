# Filtering for Heston and Variance Gamma Stochastic Arrival (VGSA) Process
Applications of various Kalman Filters and Particle Filter (sequential Monte Carlo method) on stochastic processes such as Heston and VGSA

# Setup
We suggest setting up a virtual environment to run the provided codes:
```
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
Run `python -r requirements.txt` to install all required packages. Run `jupyter notebook` to run notebooks.

# Acknowledgement
We would like to thank Prof. Hirsa for his guidance on this project.
